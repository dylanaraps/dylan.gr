# How to Barefoot

Growing up by the beach in Bayside Melbourne I was often barefoot. All Summer 
long, my brother, friends and I would run around town and in and out of each
other's houses. Entire days were spent at the beach and the local pier where
we'd jump off and swim amongst giant stingrays to the shock and dismay of
tourists.

When we later moved to the city, the opportunity and possibility of being
barefoot was gone and I began to wear shoes outside of the house. To be
barefoot in the city was seen as derelict behavior (or in the slang of the
time, "dero").  But, even if it were acceptable, the uncleanliness of the urban
environment alone was reason enough to be shod.

For many years I jammed, crammed and squished my feet into pointy shoes shaped
nothing like feet. Over time my feet became weak and lost their full function.
Muscles atrophied, arches flattened and mild tailor's bunions formed. This
happened so slowly I didn't notice. 

It was when my family and I moved to Greece I fully embraced barefootedness.
Settling in a rural area, I had the opportunity to ditch the shoes for the
roughly ten month period where bare feet outdoors won't freeze.

Greece (outside of the major cities) modernized relatively late and many people
upon seeing my unshod feet told me fond memories of a youth where they too 
didn't wear shoes. Of course, it was done out of necessity since shoes were
expensive, and in many cases, even if they owned a pair, they were reserved for
church and other special occasions.

My grandmother tells me often of her youth when she was barefoot in her
village, spending hours in the fields with the animals and walking kilometres
on rocky mountain paths. When at the age of ten and without telling anyone she
followed her older cousin to the city, the family that took her in as a maid
supplied her with her first pair of shoes.

An Auntie of mine also told me stories. In the 70s they lived without running
water or electricity and of course without shoes. A raging but now dry river had 
to be crossed to get to the nearest town. She tells me how they could see the
lights in the distance at night from their darkness and wonder about the great
city.

It has become so rare to see unshod feed that I have been stopped on the street 
by many an old lady tut-tutting and offering to buy me shoes, under the 
assumption that I am barefoot because I can't afford them.

I first started taking long walks barefoot in the town and nearby fields, hills
and beachside, making sure to walk over as many different surfaces as I could to 
desensitize and strengthen my feet. Before long, it became second nature and
the conscious idea I was barefoot faded from my mind. I could again walk with
ease on asphalt to the beach in the midday Summer sun without injuring my soles.

When I quit vice and started exercising, unfit as I was, I began running. My 
plan was simple: Run in one direction until I reached a specific landmark, turn
around and run home. For each subsequent run, the landmark would be moved a few
hundred metres and the process repeated.

The plan a success, over the next couple of months I increased the distance to
around 6km. I did however keep injuring myself, and it would often take up to
ten days before I could run again. Obviously unsustainable and risking serious
injury were I to continue. The problem was twofold, 1\) I increased distance
and speed too quickly. 2\) I wasn't running properly.

I also came to realize just how _weak_ shoes made my lower body and affected my
overall posture. Calves sore for days after runs were the reason for many a
rest period. My feet would tingle due to the sensory overload caused by
thousands of steps on gravel, rocks, grass, asphalt and other surfaces.

I was trying to run as though I was wearing shoes and running barefoot is very 
different to running shod. Accustomed to running in shoes, running barefoot 
felt like learning how to run all over again. The ground beneath and the impact 
of each and every footstep was felt and unless I slowed down and listened to
my body, I was welcoming injury and pain.

Doing so, I slowed down my running and lowered the distance, with one mantra in
mind: be loose and tread lightly. This was the singular focus in my mind as I
ran. If I could make each step as gentle as possible, I was certain I would be
able to run barefoot without issue. Over many months, my form naturally
corrected itself and I could finally run without risk of injury. I knew I was
doing it right when I felt better and more energized after a run than before it.

My feet are very different now compared to before I started running. Much wider, 
arches re-formed and the tailor's bunions largely corrected. The soles are like 
toughened leather, and no puncture by glass or thorns can draw blood.

July 2025 I started running at least 5km everyday and maintained this streak
through to December without issue and not even a blister. Come Springtime, I 
will pick it up again. 

To be barefoot is to be connected to the earth. It feels good and is the
natural way. Our feet are sensitive for a reason, to sense the world around us.
And yet, we shut them up in deforming, synthetic shoes, hiding them from the
world and losing touch with it. Many people I know fear even taking off their
shoes believing themselves unable to live without them even though as children, 
they ran barefoot up and down the countryside.

I run barefoot, because it is free. There is no need to buy anything. There are 
no uniforms, equipment or rules. Under the sun, in the fresh air of the 
hillside, I just start moving.
