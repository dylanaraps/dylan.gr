# You Are The Sum

Right now, this moment, you are the sum of all of your past thoughts, actions
and decisions. Everything you have experienced, good or bad, has resulted in 
what you are today. Your life is in _your_ hands and your hands alone and the
present, a creation of your past.

But, in what kind of present do you find yourself? A good one or a bad one?  Is
it like Heaven or like Hell? Are you a good person? Are you happy? Are you
healthy? Are you at peace? Are you well? Where will you go from here?

Change your thoughts and actions and over time you will change yourself.
Changing yourself, the people around you will change and in turn, the people
around _them_ will change. Change yourself and you change the world.

Future you is the sum of everything starting from any present moment. Will your 
present actions result in the future self you aim to be? If not, what in the 
hell are you doing? Why are you walking down a road you know will lead to a
worse present than the current one?

The time to change is now as it is the only time change is possible. Imagine
your desired future and start walking towards it. That road is straight and 
narrow, find it and walk. Step by step, walk in the right direction and you will 
get there. The road leads only to one place. 

On the road to New York, you might stop along the way but you won't end up in 
San Francisco.

Compare yourself not to others but to your past and future selves. Are you 
a better person today than you were yesterday? Are you living up to the future 
self you wish to be? 

Change is difficult in the beginning but in the beginning, everything is
difficult. When change becomes habit it becomes invisible and effortless. The 
thousand steps looked back on are easier than the single step not walked. 

Aim upwards. That is life's purpose. You are the sum. Get walking.
