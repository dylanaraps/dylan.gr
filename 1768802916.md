# What Drew Me To Software Development And Open Source

Though I have a love-hate relationship with computers (and technology
generally), it's always been something I've had an affinity with. My mother
tells me that at the age of three and before being able to read, I was surfing
the internet unsupervised on her personal computer.

I remember the first day of school where the teacher asked the class "How many
of you have a computer at home?" and "How many of you have internet at home?"
A third of the class had a computer and a third of those with a computer had
dial up internet. 

Most classrooms had five or six computers lined up against a wall and computer
usage was an extra on top of the regular curriculum. It wasn't long before we
were bypassing the school's internet restrictions and downloading music, 
watching videos and playing flash games.

The Nintendo DS was released and my brother and I proceeded to use flash-carts
to run homebrew (music players, video players, emulators), rom-hacks, cheats
and otherwise inaccessible games. I have fond memories of school trips where
everyone chatted over "pictochat" [0] and played many games through DS download
play [1].

Then, the iPod Touch came out and it too became something to mess around and
tinker with. We promptly jailbroke [2] ours and installed themes, tweaks, 
emulators, games and other software. We became hooked on the Legend of Zelda
MMORPG clone, "Graal Online Classic" [3]. I became a moderator of this MMO and
created pixel artwork for it (under the pseudonym "Bam") which still exists in 
the game to this day.

My primary school learning of this jailbreaking expertise from my teacher had me 
jailbreak the entire stack of new iPads they bought for use in the classroom.
I won't mention what they wanted them jailbroken for.

As we got older our interests shifted to computers and our parents bought us
secondhand and sluggish thinkpad laptops. We played, modded and tinkered with 
countless games and emulators and were particularly fond of Minecraft and 
Counterstrike. Most games didn't run well, but it didn't matter to us. 

This was also the era where (at the age of 10) we would jump on "Chat Roulette", 
talk to strangers and see things we probably shouldn't. Facebook still had an 
innocence to it and the feed actually contained a chronological listing of 
friend's posts rather than an algorithmic soup of advertising nonsense. I spent 
too much time on forums and made a lot of friends, no one knowing my age,
location or identity, or me, theirs.

When my brother and I turned 14 and 15 respectively, we nagged our parents to
allow us to build our own computers. Each given a budget of \$600, we planned,
bought parts and then constructed our first computers. It was difficult to try 
and squeeze as much performance as possible out of our constrained budget. The 
specifications were as follows: AMD FX 6300 CPU, 4GB memory and an NVIDIA 650 TI 
or Radeon HD 7950. Over the years we upgraded these computers and they ran for 
nearly a decade.

Valve was working on porting Steam to Linux and ran a promotion in the game
Team Fortress 2 to entice players to try the game on Linux. For a few weeks,
anyone who launched the game on Linux received a cosmetic "Tux the penguin"
item. [4] I installed Linux Mint and collected the item through many Steam
accounts (betting on future tradeability which never materialized).

From here onwards I ran Linux on my computer and never went back to Windows.
Trying various Ubuntu flavours, I finally settled on Arch Linux which I used 
for many years. Initially, my time was spent tinkering and customizing my
desktop. I explored everything, from tiling window managers to modal text 
editors and through Linux, another world opened up to me. 

I began programming and found it insanely difficult in the beginning. Unable to 
wrap my head around it, I have memories of starting the "Learn Python" tutorial,
struggling to understand it, getting frustrated and finally giving up. It was as 
though programming and I were incompatible. It was only later through writing
shell-script that everything finally clicked and I began to program with ease.

I created simple websites and learned the ins and outs of HTML, CSS and 
JavaScript. I began writing small programs in bash shell-script and Python. 
Around 2015, I wrote my first "major" software program "Neofetch" which became 
wildly popular. One program led to another and eventually I had 
created dozens and dozens of projects in many languages, all Open Source.

Programming became a labour of love and it never got old seeing my ideas come to
life on the screen. It also became an addiction and something I spent far too 
much time doing. Though shell-scripting is my forte, privately, I have written 
more C than anything else and consider myself equally proficient in both.

Everything I created and ended up publishing I gave away for free with a
permissive license (MIT). I  couldn't bring myself to turn my projects into
products, restrict their usage or charge a fee. I couldn't create projects in
order to make money and for these reasons, I never worked in the industry.

When I entered my twenties, my interests shifted to minimalism and living with
little reliance on technology, my later projects all sharing this philosophy.
I've come to see technology as a means to an end rather than the end itself and
limit its presence in my life.  

As a first solution to my [burn out](/1768295794), I had plans to release a
video game in an engine of my creation. The idea was that I would work at my
own pace and without the stress and burden of my open source projects. After
tens of thousands of lines of code, many rewrites and more burn out, I scrapped
the idea and stopped programming for a time. In hindsight, this game project was 
a lousy solution to the problem.

Today, even though I don't program much, it's still a love of mine and every now 
and then, I tinker. At a snail's pace I am privately working on my own POSIX 
shell which I plan to extend with optional extras that make writing complex
programs in it realistic. 

I think I'll always be a programmer.

- [0] Pictochat enabled wireless communication between all DS devices in close
proximity to one another.
- [1] DS download play allowed one person with Mario Kart DS for example, to
create a multiplayer game and wirelessly play with up to **seven other players** 
who didn't have the game.
