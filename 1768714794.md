# Olive Oil: Then and Now

The standard way olives are harvested in Greece by small and big producers 
alike is typically to get in and get out in as little time as possible using any
available means to do so. The biggest producers eliminate the human element
entirely by employing large machines which mechanically harvest the olives by
putting a vice around each tree and violently shaking it.

Typically, the work begins early morning when cars and pickup trucks are driven
into the olive grove and parked inbetween the trees. Vehicles are necessary to
bring machinery and power tools, and at the end of the day, haul machinery and 
the gathered olives away.

A vehicle or petrol generator is then started to power the handheld olive 
harvesting tools. These agitate the branches causing fruit and leaves to fall 
from the tree. Plastic tarps or nets are laid out underneath the currently 
worked on group of trees to catch the olives and leaves as they fall.

Meanwhile, petrol powered chainsaws are used to prune the trees while the 
harvest takes place. Debate rages at this time as to how much or how little to 
prune and always falls to the side of extreme or excessive. The prunings with 
olives on them are immediately passed through a machine which strips them of 
their fruit and leaves.

Once a group of trees is done, the tarps are folded over and any twigs, sticks
or small branches are removed. The olives and leaves are then packed into
plastic sacks and set aside to be collected. The tarps are then dragged to the
next group of trees and the process continues until the end of the day when the
sacks are loaded onto a vehicle and taken home.

If the producer has their own mill or is fortunate enough to have a same day
appointment at a public mill, their oil will be pressed within hours of harvest. 
The majority of small to medium producers however, relying on regional mills, 
wait their turn in a queue.

So day by day, the sacks accumulate. The olives can be sitting and sweating in
plastic sacks for many days until the appointed time where they are taken and
pressed into oil. Once the harvest is complete, the prunings are typically
piled up and burned on site. The concept of mulching is largely foreign to the
Mediterranean.

Public mills are just that, public. To accommodate the large number of people
in the queue, the focus is by necessity on passing through as many olives as
possible. It is unfeasible for the operator to stop the process and clean the
machinery (which can take hours) between customers. Any oil produced therefore
is at the mercy of the oil in the queue before it.

As it is uncommon for producers to sell directly to consumers, the bulk of the 
oil is sold to the mill at the time of pressing, the grower taking home a 
quantity for friends and family only.

Thus the mill buys up the oil from most of its customers, blending it all 
together and later selling it to wholesalers. The wholesalers take this oil, 
blend it together with oil from other mills and again sell it on. This bulk oil 
is then bought by food companies, cosmetic companies, supermarket chains or even 
larger wholesalers. The largest wholesalers typically export the oil.

## The Consequences

The burning of prunings, chainsaw use, automobiles, generators and petrol
powered machines pollute not only the oil but also the soil, trees and olives. 
The lubricants used in chainsaws create <a href="https://www.oliveoiltimes.com/business/europe/europe-tightens-restrictions-on-hydrocarbons-in-virgin-olive-oil/134188">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)</a>
which the EU is trying to better regulate. The plastic tarps and sacks readily 
shed microplastics which can make their way into both oil and soil.

When handheld olive harvesting tools are used to agitate the tree, the force
applied is always the same and when the tool meets resistance it can only power
through it. It is impossible for the operator to be gentle and is the reason why 
small branches, twigs and leaves come down with the fruit.

Using chainsaws to facilitate pruning often results in overpruned trees. The
ease with which branches are lopped off compared to a hand saw enables pruning
beyond what is necessary for the welfare of the tree.

Each cut is a wound. When the cuts get bigger and higher in number, so does
the time and energy needed by the tree to close and heal these. Excessive 
pruning also disrupts the balance between foliage and roots, creating an energy 
imbalance the tree must correct. If it rains before the tree closes its wounds,
healing is slowed and risk of disease increases.

By these practices the lifespan of the tree is reduced and it is unlikely that
trees under these conditions will live potential centuries. The effects are
visible. Post-harvest, the trees look tired and worn out.

## How It Was

It wasn't always like this. Speak to any old timer and with a faraway look in
their eyes they will reminisce about other days. Extended families would come
together at each other's groves and without the use of plastics, machinery or
tools they would hand pick the olives and collect them in cane baskets. Any that 
were on the ground would be picked up by youngsters. Everyone in the family was 
involved, it was a labour of love.

At midday, the small swarm of olive gatherers would sit under the shade of the
trees and eat from a selection of prepared dishes. There was camaraderie,
laughter and much discussion. They were not pressed for time nor was there a
push to ramp up production.

Every village had its own mill and there the olives would be processed family
after family everyone helping and everyone taking their share. 

The pruning was conducted by handsaw and the trees allowed to grow tall.
There are still remnants of these trees towering above the landscape in spots.

The trees gave their gifts and they were accepted whatever the amount. Of 
course, this was at a time where olive oil was not shipped to the four corners 
of the earth but rather consumed locally as the staple fat of the region (much
like coconut in the Pacific).

Once it became a global commodity and production scaled up, it also became 
inherently necessary for vehicles, machines, tools and the like to replace 
manual human labour in order to meet demand. The focus was shifted from personal
consumption to profit. At the same time, the shrinking size of families and the 
loss of the youth to the city and beyond created a vacancy that only migrant 
labour could fill.

This culminated in what we have today. A hurried get in and get out process
where the only thing that matters is yield. The old way can still be found here 
and there however, but for the most part, it is gone, and with it, it has taken
any chance the trees have of a long life.
