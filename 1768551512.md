# KISS Linux Retrospective

*[KISS](https://kisslinux.github.io) is a Linux distribution I created in 2019 
focused on simplicity, minimalism and sustainability. It was designed to be
maintainable by a single person without any required infrastructure. The
installation contained everything necessary to make this possible (full source
code plus documentation).*

The idea was to put all of the power into the user's hands. They would decide
the makeup of their system, what software it runs, when and how it is updated
and so on. Thus removing the possibility of the rug being pulled out from under 
them (which is too often the case with how fast software moves nowadays).

Of course, this was only possible if the system was minimal, simple (in design
not use) and made up of few moving parts. The user would need a certain level
of expertise as well as discipline to make it work. *Dumb system, smart user. 
Smart system...*

This prevented KISS from gaining wide adoption and garnering a large number of 
users but that was fine. The users it attracted were smart, capable and 
dedicated enough to maintain their systems and create a nice community around 
KISS.

Due to the high barrier of entry, every user in turn became a contributor and
although at its core the distribution was small, its users expanded it, adding
support for other software and architectures. Many created forks in order to
explore different core ideas.

The repository system being decentralized meant that every user could 
independently share their repositories, packages and extensions without needing
access to infrastructure or permission from me. The user was free to at any time
disconnect from my repositories, use someone else's or even maintain their own.

I used to say that so long as there was one person using KISS *somewhere* the
distribution would live on. And... live on it has. Despite my public abandonment
of the project nearly five years ago, the distribution is still active with many
old and new users. In other words, though not perfect, KISS was a success.

*You can find KISS in the following places:*

- My old website: <https://kisslinux.github.io>
- KISS Community: <https://kisscommunity.org/> <br>(*where public development 
now takes place.<br>If you want to use KISS start here.*)

Thank you to everyone supporting it and keeping it alive.

### Addendum

Privately I still maintain my own version of KISS and tinker with its core every 
now and then trying out ideas. At the moment, my system looks as follows.

* I am using mimalloc as my system malloc.
* I am using muon in place of meson.
* I am using llvm+clang and have removed gcc, binutils, etc.
* I am using blake3 for all package management checksums.
* I am using zlib-ng in place of zlib.
* My init and service management is based on s6 (basically what I was working on
  prior to leaving.).
* I am using niri as my wayland compositor after trying it on a whim 6 months 
  ago.

If I could go back and change one thing about the distribution it would be its
release model. Instead of rolling release where maintainers are forced to work
within the constant churn of new software versions and ever moving targets, I 
believe it would've been better to make a focused and polished release every 
three months.

This is what I've come to like about the BSDs. They have polish and *cohesion*. 
Something sorely lacking in Linux distributions which feel and act as though 
they are disjointed and haphazardly constructed (because they are). 

Focus should not only be on each piece of software making up the distribution
but also on what the resulting compilation of them looks like. Software 
shouldn't be installed, it should be *integrated*.

Sure, this would necessitate larger changes to the source code of packages. From 
changing default configurations, writing missing documentation and most 
invasively, patching and making larger code modifications... So be it. With the 
extra time gained from a slow release schedule this work could be done.

Look at it this way: The software in the distribution is for the distribution 
and not the distribution for the software. But, most importantly, the 
distribution is for its users. If it's not serving its users what is it for?

These are just some ideas. I may put them to action someday, I may not.
