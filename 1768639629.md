# Wine Makes Itself

It has been said by Natural winemakers that winemaking is 90% vineyard and 10%
cellar. I believe this to be false. I reckon that wine makes itself and the
winemaker need only provide the right environment for it to do so. Wine is
inevitable.

Yet winemakers meddle with it incessantly. They analyze, alter, add, remove and
modulate every aspect of the wine from its beginning in the vineyard through to
its death in the bottle and why? Why do they find it necessary to do all of
these things? The answer lies in the fact that man no longer makes wine.

Sure, it is called wine and it does contain grape juice but this is just
happenstance. If the winemaker could rid himself of the vine he would do so
immediately and without thought. It is a hindrance to his product, his creation. 
It is a thorn in his side and an unpredictable chaos he must fight and so 
conquer, lest his product not turn out as planned.

Just as each sibling in a family is different despite coming from the same
parents and being made the same way, so was wine. Each vintage was something
different, something unique and something that could never be made again. The 
wine was alive, born in the vineyard, raised in the cellar and living out its
life in the bottle. In constant flux and different from one moment to the next
it bided its time waiting to be poured. Here lay the beauty of wine and we
destroyed it.

You see, sometime in the last century wine went from being a living, natural
and blessed gift of Nature, to a dead, standardized, man-made concoction.
Winemaking became akin to cloning; each winemaker designing an unnatural, 
artificial beverage and then forcing subsequent vintages through manipulations 
and chemistry to match identically.

The bacteria and yeasts already present on the grapes killed and replaced with a
cultivated yeast monoculture having "ideal" traits. All human skin contact
with the wine prohibited. Nothing left to chance. Taste, smell, color, clarity,
alcohol level, sugar, bitterness, sweetness, astringency, acidity, alkalinity,
free particle size, effervescence, etc., manipulated and controlled.

At the winemaker's disposal around 150 different additives to make this
possible. Once considered adulterations and fraud now standard use in trade. 
The scientific method so entrenched as habit from the biggest vineyards to the 
backyard vines, it is inconceivable for anyone to make wine outside of this 
system. Everyone now needing an oenologist to advise at a moment's notice which 
of these additives to use, at what quantities and when.

The vineyard, once a wild haphazard space where vines lived in harmony *with*,
and nurtured *by* Nature, now row after identical row of crucified vines, 
artificially fed and attached to life support. In essence the present day
vineyard is a factory farm and like all factory farm models, entirely dependent
on man and science for its survival. Nature now reduced to the chaotic disrupter
of this man-made synthetic order.

The resulting beverage standardized, sterile, unnatural and no different to
other beverages like cola or lemonade. Exactly the same, every time. A shallow
(lacking the infinite depth and diversity of life) and convenient product of 
profit-driven, reductionist minds, rather than a labour of love. And because the
winemaker is not making wine but rather playing by the rules of a man-made
system of chemistry, the winemaker is wholly and utterly dependent on it. Left
alone with the vineyard he cannot produce wine for, sadly, he has forgotten how.
Or worse still, the winemaker has never known.

And yet, here is how simply wine was made: Grapes were picked. Skins were 
broken. Juice was fermented. If fermentation is simplified to mean *time*, it 
can be reduced further: Break skin. Wait. That's all there was to it. Everything 
necessary already contained on and within the grape itself. 

Removing all preconceived ideas for what a wine should be, it is very easy to
make real wine. The vines will tell you when they are ready to be picked
and the wine too, when it is ready for the bottle. Patience is key. The whole
creation speaks, you need only listen and I believe there is no winemaking 
problem that cannot be solved by simply waiting a while.

Just as in the past, in order to make a good wine the human element is an 
absolute necessity. This is the secret: **The winemaker and his family were
present in the wine.** The grapes would be picked barefoot, without the use of 
gloves, and by unwashed hands. The same bare feet that spent hours walking up 
and down the vineyard during the morning harvest stomped the grapes uncleaned, 
that afternoon. The grapes, too, were never washed and the vines and soil never 
sprayed with any concoction natural or synthetic. 

We, like the grape and everything else, are inhabited inside and out by
bacteria. Actually, I think it makes more sense to say that we are bacteria and
that bacteria is an inseparable part of everything. By coming into contact with
the grape juice, we enter the wine. We impart a uniqueness and quality which
cannot be replicated by anyone else. And when no sulphites or preservatives are
added, the wine remains alive and ever changing, even in the bottle. We in a
sense live on in our wine and in living wine we can live forever.

But you see, this cannot be done at scale. The human element must necessarily be
removed, machines introduced and compromises made in order to produce copious
quantities of dead wine. The heightened risk of losses brings with it greater
fears and the bigger the winemaker becomes, the further he departs from real,
living wine. As the winemaker becomes rich, his wine becomes poor and with 
family removed, he finds himself all alone.

Wine makes itself. Man need only listen.
