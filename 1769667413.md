# I've Gone To Great Lengths For This Silence

Since launching https://wild.gr, I have received zero bug reports or complaints
about the website and have not found any issues posted across social media.
People love to complain online, so to receive no reports after tens of
thousands of unique page views, to me, means _technologically_, this website
was a success.

I have seen many comment sections rife with complaints about websites rather
than discussion about their content; the content becoming secondary to the
technical or stylistic issues. <q>It's too slow</q>, <q>The images are
uncompressed!</q>, <q>Text contrast is too low</q>, <q>It doesn't work with
javascript disabled</q>, <q>It looks crappy on mobile</q> and so on. Not
wanting this to happen, I carefully designed the site to get out of the way of
its content.

The way I create websites is unique. Excepting images, every page is a self
contained HTML file with no external dependencies, culminating in a single
network request for each load. My static build system embeds the favicon, css,
svg images, javascript and other assets into every page as-needed and minifies 
the resulting HTML. Compressed by the server, each page is a single 5-15kB
network request with any images loaded lazily by the browser as they come into
view.

Probably not worth a mention due to the ubiquity of the practice, all images on
the WILD website are served in multiple sizes and formats allowing the browser
to determine the right one to load. This saves bandwidth on small screens at
the expense of more disk space on the host.

Disable javascript on any of my sites and all functionality continues to work,
albeit with fewer bells and whistles. It is important to me, information stays a
navigatable web of documents instead of morphing into a clunky application
inaccessible by screen readers and simple web browsers. Viewed in terminal
browsers, all information is navigatable and accessible.

Of course, this means all business must be conducted over email, but I prefer
it this way. It retains the human element lost when business happens
automatically and robotically. The people I have met and meaningful
conversations I have had, far outweigh the manual labour.

There is no _technical_ limitation preventing largely static websites from being 
beautiful, functional, accessible and fast, at the same time. There is no
excuse for needing loading screens and 10+ second long loading times to display
some text and images.

This is what makes my websites so fast and it is only possible by doing away
with complicated frameworks, heavy web fonts and third-party integrations like
invasive analytics, payment processing, advertising and social media embeds.

I've spent a lot of time ensuring my websites [WILD](https://wild.gr), 
[KISS Linux](https://kisslinux.github.io) and [personal blog](https://dylan.gr) 
remain small, simple and fast. To quote "God" from Futurama: <q>When you do
things right, people won’t be sure you’ve done anything at all</q>. 

I've gone to great lengths for this silence.

P.S. I am sure to get bug reports from this post as it will prompt people to go 
looking, and bugs if sought, will be found. Send me an email if you find any.
